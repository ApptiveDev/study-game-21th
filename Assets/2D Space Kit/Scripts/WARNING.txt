If you try to build your entire game based off of these scripts, you're going to have a bad time.

These were written fairly quickly for the sole purpose of providing a live demonstration.

Scripts that are okay:

ParallaxLayer.cs
PSDestroy.cs (But I mean, it's one line of code, could it really be considered a script? XD)

All other scripts probably shouldn't be used for anything beyond reference.

What they are good for, however, is helping people who may be new to Unity in understanding the math and logic for certain things. By all means, use them as guidelines, but remember they weren't written with a full game in mind.
